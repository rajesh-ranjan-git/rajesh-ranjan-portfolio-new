      <p className="">
        I’m a passionate and results-driven Full Stack Developer with over 6
        years of professional experience, currently working at Business Today
        Technology, part of the India Today Group. I specialize in building
        scalable and high-performance web applications using modern
        technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        My expertise lies in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js,
        Node.js), along with Next.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript for frontend
        and backend development. I also have strong experience with SQL,
        PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM, and MongoDB, giving me a versatile edge in both
        relational and non-relational databases.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my core stack, I’ve worked with Java and Python, enabling
        me to adapt to diverse project requirements and technical challenges. I
        take pride in writing clean, efficient code and delivering end-to-end
        solutions that drive real business impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m always looking for opportunities to collaborate on innovative
        projects and contribute to tech communities.
