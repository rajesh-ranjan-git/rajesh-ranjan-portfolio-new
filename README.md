## About Me

Hi, I'm Rajesh Ranjan, a passionate and results-driven Full Stack Developer with over 6 years of professional experience, currently working at Business Today Technology, part of the India Today Group. I specialize in building scalable and high-performance web applications using modern technologies.

In addition to my core stack, I’ve worked with Java and Python, enabling me to adapt to diverse project requirements and technical challenges. I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and delivering end-to-end solutions that drive real business impact.
